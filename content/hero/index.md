I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the [Computational Media and Arts Thrust](https://cma.hkust-gz.edu.cn/) at the Information Hub, [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), co-supervised by [Prof. Wei Zeng](https://zeng-wei.com/) and [Prof. Kang Zhang](https://cma.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-regular/kang-zhang/).

My research focuses on **Human-AI Collaboration for Environmental Design**, primarily utilizing <u>Generative AI</u> (GenAI) and <u>Human-Computer Interaction</u> (HCI) methodologies.
Currently, I am investigating two key stages in the design process:

- **Perception :** Exploring and enhancing GenAI's capability to perceive, reason, and align with complex human-centric values.

- **Action :** Designing and evaluating collaborative systems based on HCI principles, integrating GenAI into real-world design workflows for both designers and non-designers.
