- Urban Systems and Computational Problem Formulation
During my master's studies, my attention shifted from individual buildings to the **urban design**, focusing on how individual structures collectively constitute the fabric of streets, communities, and the city at large.
A primary focus of my research during this period was the **Problem Formulation phase of the design process**. Under the supervision of _Prof. Yu Ye_ at Tongji University, my research focuses on exploring how computational methods and urban data can objectively uncover latent patterns and systemic issues within the urban space, thereby empowering designers to formulate more precise and impactful problems. -->
