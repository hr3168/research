State-of-the-art MLLMs struggle with architectural heritage interpretation, failing our benchmark on analyzing nuanced **spatial structure** and **semantic information**. This stems from a critical data scarcity bottleneck.
To address this, we developed a data augmentation framework using <u>a diffusion model integrated with structural-aware and semantic-aware modules</u>, generating **1,672** high-fidelity synthetic images (and **59,884 VQA** samples) that preserve structural and semantic fidelity while avoiding training noise.
Quantitative evaluations confirm that MLLMs fine-tuned on our dataset show significantly enhanced spatial and semantic reasoning without overfitting or interference effects.
