Professional drawings often challenge non-experts in **spatial understanding** and **intent expression**. ManyViews is a tool for citizen engagement enhancement by enabling the envisioning of design proposals and integrating diverse viewpoints in a three-stage pipeline:

- **View Transformation** uses <u>_GenAI_</u> to create human-perspective renderings;
- **Rendering Edition** enables <u>_cross-modal editing_</u> for user-friendly design suggestions;
- **Viewpoint Visualization** compiles designs from participants in <u>_provenance visualization_</u>.
