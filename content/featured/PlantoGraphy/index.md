While recent GenAI enables automated landscape rendering, existing end-to-end methods are not compatible with common design processes.
This creativity support system addresses this core challenge by introducing **_scene graphs_** and **_layouts_** as a key representation to act as an interactive bridge between the designer's intent and the GenAI, allowing for the configuration of GenAI models to accommodate iterative design workflows.
